Example of a program for Project 0 of Electronic Instrumentation Systems.

The code will read a voltage signal in AN0 pin at a sampling frequency Samp\+Freq, deliver that value as the argument to the function transfer\+Function() and generate a PWM signal, where the duty-\/cycle is controller by the output of transfer\+Function() and the frequency is PWMfreq. Both Samp\+Freq and PWMfreq are defined as constants in the main().

This example is distributed as a main file (in main\+Proj0.\+c) and the header files of the modules used in the project\+:
